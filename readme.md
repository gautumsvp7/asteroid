# Asteroid Hazard Prediction Using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a near-Earth object (NEO) is potentially hazardous based on its physical and orbital parameters. 
The focus was to build a deployable machine learning model that handles severe class imbalance and achieves high recall for hazardous predictions.


**Features Used:**
- Estimated Diameter (km)
- Velocity (km/h)
- Distance from Earth (km)

**Target Variable:**
- `is_hazardous` (binary classification)


##  Key Features

###  Feature Engineering
- Derived a new metric called `risk_score`:  
  \[(diameter \u00d7 velocity\u00b2) / distance\]
- Normalized using `MinMaxScaler` for consistent input distribution.

### Handling Imbalanced Data
- Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to balance classes in training data.
- Test data remains untouched to simulate real-world distributions.

### Model Building
- Used Pipeline with the following steps:
  - MinMaxScaler
  - SMOTE
  - Logistic Regression (`class_weight='balanced'`)
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC-AUC
  - Precision-Recall Curves


## Model Performance
- **ROC-AUC:** `0.96`
- **Accuracy:** `94.4%` (after threshold tuning)
- Strong recall for the hazardous class with low false negatives


## Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- matplotlib
- joblib
